🌐 Blockchain-Based Decentralized Social Network 📡
Overview 🚀
Welcome to the Blockchain-Based Decentralized Social Network! This project aims to provide a decentralized platform where users can interact, share content, and maintain control of their data through blockchain technology. It leverages the Solana blockchain, Rust, and Anchor framework to ensure security, scalability, and decentralization.

The frontend is built with Vue.js for dynamic user interfaces, and the backend utilizes Node.js for efficient server-side operations.

🚨 Software Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following software:

1. Operating System 🌍
Unix Family (Preferably Ubuntu): A Linux-based OS is required for ease of installation and use of required tools.
2. Crypto-Wallet 🪙
Phantom Wallet: An easy-to-use crypto wallet to store, send, receive, and swap tokens on the Solana blockchain. Phantom makes it simple and secure to manage your digital assets, such as SOL tokens and NFTs.
3. Solana CLI Tools 🛠️
Solana CLI: Command-line tools to interact with the Solana blockchain. These tools allow you to deploy smart contracts, manage accounts, and interact with the network.
4. Rust 🦀
Rust: A systems programming language focused on safety and performance, especially for safe concurrency. Rust is used to write the blockchain's core functionality and smart contracts.
5. Cargo 📦
Cargo: The Rust package manager that handles downloading dependencies, compiling Rust code, and managing package uploads to crates.io (Rust’s package registry).
6. Anchor ⚓
Anchor: A framework built on top of Solana’s Sealevel runtime. It provides a developer-friendly toolkit for writing and deploying smart contracts on Solana with safety and efficiency.
7. Vue.js 🔮
Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building dynamic, single-page user interfaces. It’s lightweight and flexible, making it perfect for building modern web applications.
8. Node.js 🖥️
Node.js: A cross-platform JavaScript runtime that executes code outside the browser. It's used to run the backend services of the decentralized social network, handling user requests, authentication, and blockchain interactions.
💻 Hardware Requirements
To ensure optimal performance, your system should meet the following hardware requirements:

Memory: 16GB of RAM
Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-1135G7 @ 2.40GHz × 8 or higher (11th Gen)
Disk Capacity: 512GB of storage space or higher
